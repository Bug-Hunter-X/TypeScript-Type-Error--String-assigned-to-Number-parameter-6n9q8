This repository contains a simple TypeScript example demonstrating a common type error. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers, but the code attempts to pass a string as the second argument. The TypeScript compiler correctly identifies this type mismatch and throws an error. The solution shows how to fix this with type assertions or by ensuring the function receives the correct data type.
